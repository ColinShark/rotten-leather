# Rotten Leather

A simple datapack that allows crafting [Leather] from [Rotten Flesh][RF].

## Installation

1. [Download this repository][DL] as a [`.zip`][DL] file
2. Extract the contained folder [into your world's `datapacks` folder][Install]
3. Run `/datapack enable` and check the tab completion to enable the datapack

## Inspiration

I was annoyed by the lack of leather and abundance of rotten flesh and its uselessness.
So I made myself a little datapack because I felt it was easier than installing a modded
server and a random mod. Also this lets me have more control over what it actually does.
